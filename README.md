# Raw Phenotypes
This module was designed for storing the raw phenotpic data being collected as part of ["Application of genomics to innovation in the Lentil Economy (AGILE)" project](http://knowpulse.usask.ca/portal/project/AGILE%3A-Application-of-Genomic-Innovation-in-the-Lentil-Economy). 

__This module is currently not ready for use outside of KnowPulse. If you are interested in our functionality, feel free to contact us.__

## Dependencies
1. [Drag & Drop Upload](https://www.drupal.org/project/dragndrop_upload)

__Note: there are some modifications needed to the spreadsheet reader to get it to handle dates the way we expect. There will be a patch available in the future.__
